# ECE 143 - Individual Project

The goal of this project is to generate rectangular subsections of ad-hoc networks. Each rectangle is independent randomly generated on a grid. One single network cannot span the entire grid and following networks must be trimmed to maximum coverage if it intersects an existing, previous network. This project can support a 10x10 grid as well as any other dimension specified by the user by changing parameters in the code.

A detailed explaination and answers to questions will be documented below. 

## Getting Started

The project contains one Jupyter notebook.

### Prerequisites

This project uses the libraries random, matplotlib.pyplot, and matplotlib.patches.

```
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as patches
```


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system


### Discussion

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Trade-Offs and Limitations

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Analysis

Questions:

1. Given an overall desired coverage footprint and a sequence of n communications
towers, what is the resulting resolved coverage?

- blah

2. What is the total area of coverage relative to the desired total coverage area of the
original footprint? That is, are there any gaps in coverage?

- blah

3. On average, how many communications towers are required before full coverage is
obtained?

- blah
