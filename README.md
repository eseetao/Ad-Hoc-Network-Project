# ECE 143 - Individual Project

The goal of this project is to generate rectangular subsections of ad-hoc networks. Each rectangle is independent randomly generated on a grid. One single network cannot span the entire grid and following networks must be trimmed to maximum coverage if it intersects an existing, previous network. This project can support a 10x10 grid as well as any other dimension specified by the user by changing parameters in the code.

A detailed explaination and answers to questions will be documented below. 

## Getting Started

The project contains one Jupyter notebook that can run out of the box.

### Prerequisites

This project uses the libraries random, matplotlib.pyplot, and matplotlib.patches.

```
import random
